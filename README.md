# Spring Security Learning Project

This project was created as part of my learning Spring Security by building and experimenting with various authentication and authorization mechanisms in Spring Boot applications. My goal was to understand how Spring Security works under the hood and how to apply it to secure modern web applications.

## What I Learned

Throughout this project, I worked through and implemented the following topics:

- Fundamentals of Spring Security and the security filter chain
- Configuring authentication and authorization
- Creating a custom `UserDetailsService`, working with users stored in a database
- Stateless authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Creating and validating access and refresh tokens
- Role-based access control
- Custom login form and custom authentication filters
- Securing REST APIs in the backend
- Separating public vs protected resources




## Purpose of the project

This is not meant to be a production-ready application, but rather a series of practical exercises and implementations of security mechanisms.
